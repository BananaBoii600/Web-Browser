# Python-Web-Browser

[![Python 3.6](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.6-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/)

The most simplest web browser written in python using [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/) and [PyQtWebEngine](https://pypi.org/project/PyQtWebEngine/)

The Code is cleanly written and can be easily edited

This browser uses google as the default engine for browsing and all the websites available in google will be available in this browser

# Dependencies

The code requires [python](https://www.python.org/downloads) to be installed in your computer

Make sure your python and pip version is up to date before using the app

Before using the app, make sure you install PyQt5 and PyQtWebEngine by entering the command
```sh
pip install PyQt5
```
and
```sh
pip install PyQtWebEngine
```
in the command prompt/terminal

# Setup

Install the latest provided release and run the exe file

I will also try my best to provide Linux and Mac versions in the very near future

***Note that the file is quite big cuz PyQt is a big package***

# Thank you for downloading :)
